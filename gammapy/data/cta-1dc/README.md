# CTA 1DC files

This folder contains the IRFs and a few event files from the first CTA data challenge.

These can be used for tests and tutorials.

The corresponding prod3 IRFs are public since Dec 2017:

We took the files from 1DC, not from  `CTA-Performance-prod3b-v1-FITS1.tar.gz`
The copy of the subset of files is scripted in `make.py`.
