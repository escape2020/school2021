    "Most of scientific data formats, were not designed for serialisation (distribution of data over machines) originally and they often use compression to reduce the size on disk. Needless to say that default Spark cannot read those natively.\n",
    "\n",
    "First attempts to connect those data formats (see e.g. [1] for FITS) with Spark were using the indirect method above. By reading files as binary streams, the indirect method has the advantage of having access to all FITS functionalities implemented in the underlying user library. This can be an advantage when working with the Python API for example which already contains many great scientific libraries. However this indirect method assumes each Spark mapper will receive and handle one entire file (since the filenames are parallelized and entire file data must be reconstructed from binary once the file has been opened by a Spark mapper). Therefore each single file must fit within the memory of a Spark mapper, hence the indirect method cannot distribute a dataset made of large FITS files (e.g. in [1] they have a 65 GB dataset made of 11,150 files). In addition by assuming each Spark mapper will receive and handle one entire file, the indirect method will have a poor load balancing if the dataset is made of files with not all the same size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately Apache Spark low-level layers are sufficiently well written to allow extending the framework and write native connectors for any kind of data sources. Recently connectors for FITS, HDF5 and ROOT were made available [2, 3, 4] to the community. With such connectors, there is a guarantee of having a good load balancing regardless the structure of the dataset and the size of the input files is no more a problem (a 1 TB dataset made of thousand 1 GB files or one single 1 TB file will be viewed as almost the same by a native Spark connector). Note however that the Data Source API is in Java/Scala and if there is no library to play with your data source in those languages you must implement it (what has been done in [2]) or interface with another language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the low-level layers dealing with the data sources have been recently updated. Apache Spark 2.3 introduced the Data Source API version 2. While the version 1 is still available and usable for a long time, we expect that all Spark connectors will comply with this v2 in the future.\n",
