<!-- Dear instructor:
* The dates at the top of this markdown (.md) document will help order the classes in the portal.
Please, if you don't need to, do not change the one that is now.
* Take into account that there is a feature in the dates: if you use a date in the future, the class will be not visible in the portal until the date you have assigned.
* You can create dedicated folders if you need to.
* But if you simply need to add some pictures, you can use the folder ../static/img/ mentioned at the top as /school2021/img/

# ESCAPE data science summer school 2021: Apache Spark

Welcome to the Apache Spark lecture! Please, read carefuly the instruction at this [page](https://github.com/escape2020/school2021/tree/main/spark) before starting the lecture as it contains materials and important information to set it up. 

### Session 2

In this session, we will use the Apache Spark Python API (PySpark) and learn on concrete examples how to interface and play with popular scientific libraries (Numpy, Pandas, ...). We will also see how to test and debug a code written with Spark, and integrate it in a Continuous Integration pipeline.

### Session 3

For the last session, we will finish with concrete applications in the domain of astronomy: catalog & image manipulation, machine learning and streaming data (if time permits).
