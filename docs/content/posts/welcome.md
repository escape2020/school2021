Welcome to the ESCAPE Summer school

<!--more-->
<!---->

<!-- Dear instructor:
* The dates at the top of this markdown (.md) document will help order the classes in the portal.
Please, if you don't need to, do not change the one that is now.
* Take into account that there is a feature in the dates: if you use a date in the future, the class will be not visible in the portal until the date you have assigned.
* You can create dedicated folders if you need to.
* But if you simply need to add some pictures, you can use the folder ../static/img/ mentioned at the top as /school2021/img/

# Welcome to the ESCAPE Summer School


## The ESCAPE project

https://projectescape.eu/


## The school organisation

### Communication

#### Slack
You shall have received an invitation link to slack by email (the one you used to register to the school).
Slack will be used throughout the school as the main communication channel between participants, tutors and organizers.

#### GatherTown

You shall have received an invitation link to GatherTown by email (the one you used to register to the school).
GatherTown is a platform where you can meet fellows as you would in real life, discuss about the school or other topics, but also have fun.
This is the main place we will meet during coffee breaks or breakout sessions for small groups exercises and discussions.

Note however that the platform is limited to 200 simultaneous connections. Please be considerate, if you are not using the platform, just disconnect.
It will be rebooted everyday before the lectures to make a fresh start.

### Lectures
The lectures will be streamed live on YouTube, recorded and fully accessible afterwards.

During the lectures, you will be able to ask questions in the corresponding slack channel.
Questions will be selected by the chairman for the tutors, while others will be answered directly in the chat.
