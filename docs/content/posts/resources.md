Additionnal resources

<!--more-->

<!---->

<!-- Dear instructor:
* The dates at the top of this markdown (.md) document will help order the classes in the portal.
Please, if you don't need to, do not change the one that is now.
* Take into account that there is a feature in the dates: if you use a date in the future, the class will be not visible in the portal until the date you have assigned.
* You can create dedicated folders if you need to.
* But if you simply need to add some pictures, you can use the folder ../static/img/ mentioned at the top as /school2021/img/

## Text editors

Comment in slack by @maxnoe:

First, there are three main different types of text editors:
- Graphical Text Editors open a new graphical window
- Terminal Text Editors run inside the terminal
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

Many people "more advanced" prefer the terminal based editors, because they are very accustomed to working in the terminal and they never need to leave the terminal when using a terminal based editor.
However, most terminal based editors are not easy to use for beginners and if you are still struggling with getting to know the programming languages that is an additional hurdle you can avoid by using one of the modern graphical editors.
IDEs are usually Graphical Text editors with many, many features concerning one or more programming languages and you can also mostly configure text editors with extensions to become IDEs.

###  Terminal based editors

#### Nano
Nano is a very simple terminal based editor that is easy to use, shows it's help at the bottom, is installed on basically every unix system but for example doesn't support many features for programming like syntax highlighting.

#### (neo)vim
(Neo)Vim is the text editor you saw me using in the lecture, it is hard to use for beginners, because it works very differently to other editors you might be used to. It is mode based and is very powerfull especially with lots of extensions.

#### Emacs
The other large, very extensible terminal text editor. Some people joke it has so many features that it is its own operating system, only lacking a good text editor.

#### Graphical Text Editors
There are lots, but currently I would just recommend you try out Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/), or the open source builds of it without telemetry called VS Codium (https://vscodium.com/)
Choosing a good text editor and learning how to efficiently work with it will dramatically ease your development.
Several notebooks with analysis examples and an interface to launch the framework mentioned above, are available using executable platforms.

## Libraries

Suggested by @kabartay in [issue #72](https://github.com/escape2020/school2021/issues/72)

- [AstroML](http://www.astroml.org/) - a [module](https://pypi.org/project/astroML/) for machine learning and data mining. It contains a growing library of statistical and machine learning routines for analyzing astronomical data in Python, loaders for several open astronomical datasets, and a large suite of examples of analyzing and visualizing astronomical datasets.
- [3ML](https://threeml.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - a multi-mission maximum likelihood [framework](https://pypi.org/project/threeML/) that provides a common high-level interface and model definition, which allows for an easy, coherent and intuitive modeling of sources using all the available data, no matter their origin.
- [SunPy](https://sunpy.org/) - a [package](https://pypi.org/project/sunpy/) for solar physics.
- [APLpy](https://aplpy.github.io/) - a [module](https://pypi.org/project/APLpy/) aimed at producing publication-quality plots of astronomical imaging data in FITS format.
- [SpecViz](https://specviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - a [tool](https://pypi.org/project/specviz/) for visualization and quick-look analysis of 1D astronomical spectra.
