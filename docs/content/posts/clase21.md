<!-- Dear instructor:
* The dates at the top of this markdown (.md) document will help order the classes in the portal.
Please, if you don't need to, do not change the one that is now.
* Take into account that there is a feature in the dates: if you use a date in the future, the class will be not visible in the portal until the date you have assigned.
* You can create dedicated folders if you need to.
* But if you simply need to add some pictures, you can use the folder ../static/img/ mentioned at the top as /school2021/img/

# ESCAPE data science summer school 2021: Apache Spark

Welcome to the Apache Spark lecture! Please, read carefuly the instruction at this [page](https://github.com/escape2020/school2021/tree/main/spark) before starting the lecture as it contains materials and important information to set it up. 

### Session 1

I will review the landscape of cluster computing by addressing some of the most pressing questions today: what is cluster computing? What does it mean working in a distributed environment? What are the data and computing challenges that the scientific community is facing nowadays, and how can we tackle those? Some useful concepts like functional programming and implicit parallelisation will be discussed. I will also introduce Apache Spark, a cluster computing framework for analysing large datasets that proved successful in the industry. I will specifically focus on the Apache Spark SQL module and DataFrames API, and we will start practicing through a series of simple exercises.
